# Developer Account

## Dev-Account creation

To create a developer-Account, you need to have a normal Sqowey-User-Account.
Then you can just log into the Developer-portal and we create a Dev-Account for you.

:::tip Developerportal Link
The developerportal can be found under: [http://devportal.sqowey.de/](http://devportal.sqowey.de) or [http://dev.sqowey.de/](http://dev.sqowey.de)

## Dev-Level

| Level | Apps allowed | How to? |

| 1 | 5 | Register as a dev |
| 2 | 20 | Verify E-Mail adress |
| 3 | 50 | Have 10 Applications |

| 5 | 1.000 | Have 50 actively used Applications |

:::tip Levels 6 and 9
To get to Level 6 (5.000 Applications) you donâ€™t need to do anything! Our support will contact you soon enough. If you need it, before we contacted you, just contact our support.

Level 9 is for internal developing purposes AND is given out for big Events where many small Applications are needed.
